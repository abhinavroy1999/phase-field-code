This directory contains source code which can perform morphological evolution 
in a system, governed by the Allen-Cahn equation for non-conserved order parameter. 
The phenomena which it describes is the well known order-disorder transformation 
in system consisting of two phases.
The work utilizes the Semi-Implicit Fourier Spectral Technique to solve the Cahn-
Allen equation, which has been found to be very efficient with respect to the 
restriction on the time step and grid spacing, and hence the solution are stable
and allow simulation for longer period of time.

CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY: -

1. header_file (directory): contains the header file "headers.h" with the 
                            required function prototyes.

2. input (directory):       contains text files for various simulation data required 
                            for simulation. To be altered accordingly depending on 
                            the need of simulation.

3. output (directory):      contains output of a particular run: -
                            a. input data test result
                            b. simulation data  
                            c. the output binary file for various time of evolution 
                            d. PostScript (PS) file displaying the morphological 
                               evolution for each output file).

4. source_code (directory): contains source files, namely: -
                            a. "AllenCahn.c", 
                            b. "testcode.c"
                            c. "evolution.c"

*******************************************************************************
TO RUN THIS CODE: -

If there are .o files and "Allen_Cahn_evolution.out" file present in the parent 
directory, perform the following operations: -
[command for Linux terminal (OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)]

make clean
make CLEAN
make

After 
./Allen_Cahn_evolution.out

The fresh output of a particular run will be present in the "output" directory.
