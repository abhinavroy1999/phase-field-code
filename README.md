# Phase-field modeling code
The master directory contains two separate directories: -

1. CahnHilliard2D: -
This directory contains source code which can perform morphological evolution 
in a system, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation for conserved order parameter. 
The phenomena which it describes is the well known Spinodal Decomposition in system 
consisting of two phases.

2. AllenCahn2D: -
This directory contains source code which can perform morphological evolution 
in a system, governed by the Allen-Cahn equation for non-conserved order parameter. 
The phenomena which it describes is the well known order-disorder transformation 
in system consisting of two phases.

The source codes available in this repository are developed in collaboration with the Computational Materials Engineering Group,
IIT Bombay.
The code are distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (or any later versions).

For more information regarding the codes, kindly go through the README files in the respective directories.
