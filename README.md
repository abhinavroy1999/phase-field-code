# Phase-field modeling code
The master directory contains two separate directories: -

1. CahnHilliard2D: -
This directory contains source code which can perform morphological evolution 
in a system, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation for conserved order parameter. 
The phenomenon which it describes is the well known Spinodal Decomposition in system 
consisting of two phases.

2. AllenCahn2D: -
This directory contains source code which can perform morphological evolution 
in a system, governed by the Allen-Cahn equation for non-conserved order parameter. 
The phenomena which it describes is the well known order-disorder transformation 
in system consisting of two phases.

The source codes available in this repository are developed in collaboration with the Computational Materials Engineering Group,
IIT Bombay.
The code are distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (or any later versions).

For details pertaining to execution of the code, kindly go through the README files in the respective directories.

For more information of Phase field modeling &mdash the derivation of Cahn-Hilliard equation, numerical algorithm for solving the Cahn-Hilliard and the Allen-Cahn equation, kindly refer to the NPTEL MOOC course by Prof. M. P. Gururajan titled Phase field modelling: the materials science, mathematics and computational aspects (https://nptel.ac.in/courses/113/101/113101072/)
