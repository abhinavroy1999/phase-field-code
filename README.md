# Phase-field modeling code
The master directory contains two separate folders: -

1. CahnHilliard2D: -
This directory contains source code which performs microstructure evolution in a system by numerically solving the Cahn-Hilliard equation using the semi-implicit Fourier spectral technique, for conserved order parameter. The phenomenon which it describes is the well known Spinodal Decomposition in system consisting of two components which spontaneously separate into two isostructural phases.

2. AllenCahn2D: -
This directory contains source code which performs microstructure evolution in a system by numerically solving the Allen-Cahn equation for non-conserved order parameter. 
The phenomena which it describes is the well known order-disorder transformation.

The source codes available in this repository are developed in collaboration with the Computational Materials Engineering Group, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
The code are distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (or any later versions).

For details pertaining to execution of the code, kindly go through the README files in the respective directories.

For more information on Phase field modeling â€” the derivation of Cahn-Hilliard equation, numerical algorithm for solving the Cahn-Hilliard and the Allen-Cahn equation, kindly refer to the NPTEL MOOC course by Prof. M. P. Gururajan titled Phase field modelling: the materials science, mathematics and computational aspects (https://nptel.ac.in/courses/113/101/113101072/)
